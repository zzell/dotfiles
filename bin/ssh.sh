# Script that updates the iTerm Badge with the hostname of the server that you are
# connecting to with ssh.
#
# Instructions:
# - Put this script in ~/bin/ssh (this will override the default ssh binary)
# - Run 'chmod +x ~/bin/ssh' to give execution permission to the script
# - Open iTerm\Preferences\Profiles, select your profile and put '\(user.current_ssh_host)' in the Badge text box
# - Enjoy!
#
# Troubleshoot issues:
# - If it's not working, make sure your shell is white-listed in the script (see $PARENT_COMMAND in the script)
